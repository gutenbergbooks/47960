<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This edition of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, first published in 1879, is now
thoroughly revised on the same general plan as its predecessors in the
new series.</p>

<p>While I have omitted most of the notes on textual variations, I have
retained a sufficient number to illustrate the curious and significant
differences between the first and second quartos. Among the many new
notes are some calling attention to portions of the early draft of the
play&mdash;some of them very bad&mdash;which Shakespeare left unchanged
when he revised it.</p>

<p>The references to Dowden in the notes are to his recent and valuable
edition of the play, which I did not see until this of mine was on the
point of going to the printer. The quotation on page 288 of the Appendix
is from his <cite>Shakspere: His Mind and Art</cite>, which, by the way, was
reprinted in this country at my suggestion.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION TO ROMEO AND JULIET</h2>

<h3><a name="HISTORY" id="HISTORY"></a><span class="smcap">The History of the Play</span></h3>

<p>The earliest edition of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, so far as we know, was a
quarto printed in 1597, the title-page of which asserts that "it hath
been often (with great applause) plaid publiquely." A second quarto
appeared in 1599, declared to be "newly corrected, augmented, and
amended."</p>

<p>Two other quartos appeared before the folio of 1623, one in 1609 and the
other undated; and it is doubtful which was the earlier. The undated
quarto is the first that bears the name of the author ("Written by W.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<em>Shake-speare</em>"), but this does not occur in some copies of the edition.
A fifth quarto was published in 1637.</p>

<p>The first quarto is much shorter than the second, the former having only
2232 lines, including the prologue, while the latter has 3007 lines
(Daniel). Some editors believe that the first quarto gives the author's
first draft of the play, and the second the form it took after he had
revised and enlarged it; but the majority of the best critics agree
substantially in the opinion that the first quarto was a pirated
edition, and represents in an abbreviated and imperfect form the play
subsequently printed in full in the second. The former was "made up
partly from copies of portions of the original play, partly from
recollection and from notes taken during the performance;" the latter
was from an authentic copy, and a careful comparison of the text with
the earlier one shows that in the meantime the play "underwent revision,
received some slight augmentation, and in some few places must have been
entirely rewritten." A marked instance of this rewriting&mdash;the only
one of considerable length&mdash;is in ii. 6. 6-37, where the first
quarto reads thus (spelling and pointing being modernized):&mdash;</p>

  <div class="i1">And thou art come.</div>
 </div>

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">

 </div>
 <div class="stanza">

 <div class="stanza">

 </div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The "omission, mutilation, or botching" by which some German editors
would explain all differences between the earlier and later texts will
not suffice to account for such divergence as this. "The two dialogues
do not differ merely in expressiveness and effect; they embody different
conceptions of the characters;" and yet we cannot doubt that both were
written by Shakespeare.</p>

<p>But while the second quarto is "unquestionably our best authority" for
the text of the play, it is certain that it "was not printed from the
author's manuscript, but from a transcript, the writer of which was not
only careless, but thought fit to take unwarrantable liberties with the
text." The first quarto, with all its faults and imperfections, is often
useful in the detection and correction of these errors and corruptions,
and all the modern editors have made more or less use of its readings.</p>

<p>The third quarto (1609) was a reprint of the second, from which it
"differs by a few corrections, and more frequently by additional
errors." It is from this edition that the text of the first folio is
taken, with some changes, accidental or intentional, "all generally for
the worse," except in the punctuation, which is more correct, and the
stage directions, which are more complete, than in the quarto.</p>

<p>The date of the first draft of the play has been much discussed, but
cannot be said to have been settled. The majority of the editors believe
that it was begun as early as 1561, but I think that most of them lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
too much stress on the Nurse's reference (i. 3. 22, 35) to the
"earthquake," which occurred "eleven years" earlier, and which these
critics suppose to have been the one felt in England in 1580.</p>

<p>Aside from this and other attempts to fix the date by external evidence
of a doubtful character, the internal evidence confirms the opinion that
the tragedy was an early work of the poet, and that it was subsequently
"corrected, augmented, and amended." There is a good deal of rhyme, and
much of it in the form of alternate rhyme. The alliteration, the
frequent playing upon words, and the lyrical character of many passages
also lead to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The latest editors agree substantially with this view. Herford says:
"The evidence points to 1594-1595 as the time at which the play was
substantially composed, though it is tolerably certain that some parts
of our present text were written as late as 1596-1598, and possibly that
others are as early as 1591." Dowden sums up the matter thus: "On the
whole, we might place <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>, on grounds of internal
evidence, near <cite>The Rape of Lucrece</cite>; portions may be earlier in date;
certain passages of the revised version are certainly later; but I think
that 1595 may serve as an approximation to a central date, and cannot be
far astray."</p>

<p>For myself, while agreeing substantially with these authorities, I think
that a careful comparison of what are evidently the earliest portions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of the text with similar work in <cite>Love's Labour's Lost</cite> (a play revised
like this, but retaining traces of the original form), <cite>The Two
Gentlemen of Verona</cite>, and other plays which the critics generally assign
to 1591 or 1592, proves conclusively that parts of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>
must be of quite as early a date.</p>

<p>The earliest reference to the play in the literature of the time is in a
sonnet to Shakespeare by John Weever, written probably in 1595 or 1596,
though not published until 1599. After referring to <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>
and <cite>Lucrece</cite>, Weever adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"<em class="personae">Romeo</em>, <em>Richard</em>, more whose names I know not,</div>
  <div class="i1">Their sugred tongues and power attractive beuty</div>
  <div class="i1">Say they are saints," etc.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No other allusion of earlier date than the publication of the first
quarto has been discovered.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a name="SOURCES" id="SOURCES"></a>The Sources of the Plot</span></h3>

<p>Girolamo della Corte, in his <cite>Storia di Verona</cite>, 1594, relates the story
of the play as a true event occurring in 1303; but the earlier annalists
of the city are silent on the subject. A tale very similar, the scene of
which is laid in Siena, appears in a collection of novels by Masuccio di
Salerno, printed at Naples in 1476; but Luigi da Porto, in his <cite>La
Giulietta</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> published about 1530, is the first to call the lovers
Romeo and Juliet, and to make them the children of the rival Veronese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
houses. The story was retold in French by Adrian Sevin, about 1542; and
a poetical version of it was published at Venice in 1553. It is also
found in Bandello's <cite>Novelle</cite>, 1554; and five years later Pierre
Boisteau translated it, with some variations, into French in his
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Histoire de Deux Amans</i>. The earliest English version of the romance
appeared in 1562 in a poem by Arthur Brooke founded upon Boisteau's
novel, and entitled <cite>Romeus and Juliet</cite>. A prose translation of
Boisteau's novel was given in Paynter's <cite>Palace of Pleasure</cite>, in 1567.
It was undoubtedly from these English sources, and chiefly from the poem
by Brooke, that Shakespeare drew his material. It is to be noted,
however, that Brooke speaks of having seen "the same argument lately set
forth on stage"; and it is possible that this lost play may also have
been known to Shakespeare, though we have no reason to suppose that he
made any use of it. That he followed Brooke's poem rather than Paynter's
prose version is evident from a careful comparison of the two with the
play.</p>

<p>Grant White remarks: "The tragedy follows the poem with a faithfulness
which might be called slavish, were it not that any variation from the
course of the old story was entirely unnecessary for the sake of
dramatic interest, and were there not shown in the progress of the
action, in the modification of one character and in the disposal of
another, all peculiar to the play, self-reliant dramatic intuition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the highest order. For the rest, there is not a personage or a
situation, hardly a speech, essential to Brooke's poem, which has not
its counterpart&mdash;its exalted and glorified counterpart&mdash;in the
tragedy.... In brief, <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> owes to Shakespeare only its
dramatic form and its poetic decoration. But what an exception is the
latter! It is to say that the earth owes to the sun only its verdure and
its flowers, the air only its perfume and its balm, the heavens only
their azure and their glow. Yet this must not lead us to forget that the
original tale is one of the most truthful and touching among the few
that have entranced the ear and stirred the heart of the world for ages,
or that in Shakespeare's transfiguration of it his fancy and his
youthful fire had a much larger share than his philosophy or his
imagination.</p>

<p>"The only variations from the story in the play are the three which have
just been alluded to: the compression of the action, which in the story
occupies four or five months, to within as many days, thus adding
impetuosity to a passion which had only depth, and enhancing dramatic
effect by quickening truth to vividness; the conversion of Mercutio from
a mere courtier, 'bolde emong the bashfull maydes,' 'courteous of his
speech and pleasant of devise,' into that splendid union of the knight
and the fine gentleman, in portraying which Shakespeare, with prophetic
eye piercing a century, shows us the fire of faded chivalry expiring in
a flash of wit; and the bringing-in of Paris (forgotten in the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
after his bridal disappointment) to die at Juliet's bier by the hand of
Romeo, thus gathering together all the threads of this love entanglement
to be cut at once by Fate."</p>

<h3><span class="smcap"><a name="GENERAL_COMMENTS" id="GENERAL_COMMENTS"></a>General Comments on the Play</span></h3>

<p>Coleridge, in his <cite>Notes and Lectures upon Shakespeare</cite>, says: "The
stage in Shakespeare's time was a naked room with a blanket for a
curtain, but he made it a field for monarchs. That law of unity which
has its foundations, not in the factitious necessity of custom, but in
nature itself, the unity of feeling, is everywhere and at all times
observed by Shakespeare in his plays. Read <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite>: all is
youth and spring&mdash;youth with its follies, its virtues, its
precipitancies; spring with its odours, its flowers, and its transiency.
It is one and the same feeling that commences, goes through, and ends
the play. The old men, the Capulets and the Montagues, are not common
old men; they have an eagerness, a heartiness, a vehemence, the effect
of spring; with Romeo, his change of passion, his sudden marriage, and
his rash death, are all the effects of youth; whilst in Juliet love has
all that is tender and melancholy in the nightingale, all that is
voluptuous in the rose, with whatever is sweet in the freshness of
spring; but it ends with a long deep sigh like the last breeze of the
Italian evening."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>The play, like <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>, is thoroughly Italian in
atmosphere and colour. The season, though Coleridge refers to it
figuratively as spring, is really midsummer. The time is definitely
fixed by the Nurse's talk about the age of Juliet. She asks Lady Capulet
how long it is to Lammas-tide&mdash;that is, to August 1&mdash;and the
reply is, "A fortnight and odd days"&mdash;sixteen or seventeen days we
may suppose, making the time of the conversation not far from the middle
of July. This is confirmed by allusions to the weather and other natural
phenomena in the play. At the beginning of act iii, for instance,
Benvolio says to his friends:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire;</div>
  <div class="i1">The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,</div>
  <div class="i1">And if we meet we shall not scape a brawl,</div>
  <div class="i1">For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When the Nurse goes on the errand to Romeo (ii. 4), Peter carries her
fan, and she finds occasion to use it. "The nights are only softer days,
not made for sleep, but for lingering in moonlit gardens, where the
fruit-tree tops are tipped with silver and the nightingale sings on the
pomegranate bough." It is only in the coolness of the dawn that Friar
Laurence goes forth to gather herbs; and it is</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"An hour before the worshipp'd sun</div>
  <div class="i1">Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>that we find Romeo wandering in the grove of sycamore, "with tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
augmenting the fresh morning's dew," because Rosaline will not return
his love.</p>

<p>In one instance, overlooked by the commentators generally, Shakespeare
seems to forget the time of year. In the masquerade scene (i. 5) Old
Capulet bids the servants "quench the fire" because "the room is grown
too hot." In Brooke's poem, where the action covers four or five months,
this scene is in the winter. Shakespeare, in condensing the time to less
than a single week in summer, neglected to omit this reference to a
colder season.</p>

<p>Aside from this little slip, the time is the Italian summer from first
to last. And, as a French critic remarks, "the very form of the language
comes from the South." The tale originated in Italy; "it breathes the
very spirit of her national records, her old family feuds, the amorous
and bloody intrigues which fill her annals. No one can fail to recognize
Italy in its lyric rhythm, its blindness of passion, its blossoming and
abundant vitality, in its brilliant imagery, its bold composition." All
the characters are distinctively Italian. "In total effect," as another
has said, "the play is so Italian that one may read it with increasing
surprise and delight in Verona itself."</p>

<p>Although, as I have said, it is doubtful whether the story has any
historical basis, the Montagues and the Capulets were famous old
families in Verona. Dante alludes to them in the <cite>Purgatorio</cite> (vi. 107),
though not as enemies:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"Vieni a veder Montecchi e Cappelletti,</div>
  <div class="i1">Monaldi e Filippeschi, uom senza cura,</div>

<p>The palace of the Capulets is to this day pointed out in Verona. It is
degraded to plebeian occupancy, and the only mark of its ancient dignity
is the badge of the family, the <em>cap</em> carved in stone on the inner side
of the entrance to the court, which is of ample size, surrounded by
buildings that probably formed the main part of the mansion, but are now
divided into many tenements. The garden has disappeared, having been
covered with other buildings centuries ago.</p>

<p>The so-called "tomb of Juliet" is in a less disagreeable locality, but
is unquestionably a fraud, though it has been exhibited for a century or
two, and has received many tributes from credulous and sentimental
tourists. It is in the garden of an ancient convent, and consists of an
open, dilapidated stone sarcophagus (perhaps only an old horse-trough),
without inscription or any authentic history. It is kept in a kind of
shed, the walls of which are hung with faded wreaths and other mementoes
from visitors. One pays twenty-five centesimi (five cents) for the
privilege of inspecting it. Byron went to see it in 1816, and writes
(November 6) to his sister Augusta: "I brought away four small pieces
of it for you and the babes (at least the female part of them), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
for Ada and her mother, if she will accept it from you. I thought the
situation more appropriate to the history than if it had been less
blighted. This struck me more than all the antiquities, more even than
the amphitheatre." Maria Louisa, the French empress, got a piece of it,
which she had made into hearts and other forms for bracelets and
necklaces; and many other sentimental ladies followed the royal example
before the mutilation of the relic was prohibited by its guardians.</p>

<p>To return to the play&mdash;one would suppose that the keynote was
struck with sufficient clearness in the prologue to indicate
Shakespeare's purpose and the moral lesson that he meant to impress; but
many of the critics have nevertheless failed to understand it. They have
assumed that the misfortunes of the hero and heroine were mainly due to
their own rashness or imprudence in yielding to the impulses of passion
instead of obeying the dictates of reason. They think that the dramatist
speaks through Friar Laurence when he warns them against haste in the
marriage (ii. 6. 9 fol.):&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"These violent delights have violent ends,</div>
  <div class="i1">And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,</div>
  <div class="i1">Which as they kiss consume; the sweetest honey</div>
  <div class="i1">Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,</div>
  <div class="i1">And in the taste confounds the appetite.</div>
  <div class="i1">Therefore love moderately, long love doth so;</div>
  <div class="i1">Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>But the venerable celibate speaks for himself and in keeping with the
character, not for Shakespeare.</p>

<p>Neither does the poet, as some believe, intend to read a lesson against
clandestine marriage and disregard for the authority or approval of
parents in the match. The Friar, even at the first suggestion of the
hurried and secret marriage, does not oppose or discourage it on any
such grounds; nor, in the closing scene, does he blame either the lovers
or himself on that account. Nowhere in the play is there the slightest
suggestion of so-called "poetic justice" or retribution in the fate that
overtakes the unhappy pair.</p>

<p>It is the parents, not the children, that have sinned, and the sin of
the parents is visited upon their innocent offspring. This is the burden
of the prologue; and it is most emphatically repeated at the close of
the play.</p>

<p>The feud of the two households and the civil strife that it has caused
are the first things to which the attention of those who are to witness
the play is called. Next they are told that the children of these two
foes become lovers&mdash;not foolish, rash, imprudent lovers, not
victims of disobedience to their parents, not in any way responsible for
what they afterwards suffer&mdash;but "star-cross'd lovers." The fault
is not in themselves, but in their stars&mdash;in their <em>fate</em> as the
offspring of these hostile parents. But their unfortunate and piteous
overthrow is the means by which the fatal feud of the two families is
brought to an end. The "death-mark'd love" of the children&mdash;love as
pure as it was passionate, love true from first to last to the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
law of love&mdash;while by an evil destiny it brings death to
themselves, involves also the death of the <em>hate</em> which was the primal
cause of all the tragic consequences.</p>

<p>This is no less distinctly expressed in the last speeches of the play.
After hearing the Friar's story, the Prince says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"Where be these enemies?&mdash;Capulet!&mdash;Montague!</div>
  <div class="i1">See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,</div>
  <div class="i1">That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!</div>
  <div class="i1">And I, for winking at your discords too,</div>
  <div class="i1">Have lost a brace of kinsmen; all are punish'd.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1"><em class="personae">Capulet.</em> O brother Montague, give me thy hand;</div>
  <div class="i1">This is my daughter's jointure, for no more</div>
  <div class="i1">Can I demand.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1"><em class="personae">Montague.</em> But I can give thee more;</div>
  <div class="i1">For I will raise her statue in pure gold,</div>
  <div class="i1">That while Verona by that name is known</div>
  <div class="i1">There shall no figure at such rate be set</div>
  <div class="i1">As that of true and faithful Juliet.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1"><em class="personae">Capulet.</em> As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie;</div>
  <div class="i1">Poor sacrifices of our enmity!"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is the parents who are punished. The scourge is laid upon their
<em>hate</em>, and it was the <em>love</em> of their children by which Heaven found
the means to wield that scourge. The Prince himself has a share in the
penalty for tolerating the discords of the families. "We all," he says,
"<em>all</em> are punished." But the good Friar's hope, expressed when he
consented to perform the marriage,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"For this alliance may so happy prove</div>
  <div class="i1">To turn your households' rancour to pure love,"&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>is now fulfilled. Both Capulet and Montague, as they join hands in amity
over the dead bodies of their children, acknowledge the debt they owe to
the "star-cross'd" love of those "poor sacrifices of their enmity." They
vie with each other in doing honour to the guiltless victims of their
"pernicious rage." Montague will raise the golden statue to Juliet, and
Capulet promises as rich a monument to Romeo.</p>

<p>Da Porto and Paynter and Brooke, in like manner, refer to the
reconciliation of the rival families as the fortunate result of the
tragic history. Da Porto says: "Their fathers, weeping over the bodies
of their children and overcome by mutual pity, embraced each other; so
that the long enmity between them and their houses, which neither the
prayers of their friends, nor the menaces of the Prince, nor even time
itself had been able to extinguish, was ended by the piteous death of
the two lovers." As Paynter puts it, "The Montesches and Capellets
poured forth such abundance of tears, as with the same they did evacuate
their ancient grudge and choler, whereby they were then reconciled: and
they which could not be brought to atonement<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by any wisdom or human
counsel were in the end vanquished and made friends by pity." So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Brooke, in his lumbering verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"The straungenes of the chaunce, when tryed was the truth,</div>
  <div class="i1">The Montagewes and Capelets hath moved so to ruth,</div>
  <div class="i1">That with their emptyed teares, theyr choler and theyr rage</div>
  <div class="i1">Was emptied quite; and they whose wrath no wisdom could asswage,</div>
  <div class="i1">Nor threatning of the prince, ne mynd of murthers donne</div>
  <div class="i1">At length (so mighty Jove it would) by pitye they are wonne."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And then the poem, like the play, ends with a reference to the
monumental honour done to the lovers:</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i1">"And lest that length of time might from our myndes remove</div>
  <div class="i1">The memory of so perfect, sound, and so approved love,</div>
  <div class="i1">The bodies dead, removed from vaulte where they did dye,</div>
  <div class="i1">In stately tombe, on pillers great of marble, rayse they hye.</div>
  <div class="i1">On every syde above were set, and eke beneath,</div>
  <div class="i1">Great store of cunning Epitaphes, in honor of theyr death.</div>
  <div class="i1">And even at this day the tombe is to be seene;</div>
  <div class="i1">So that among the monumentes that in Verona been,</div>
  <div class="i1">There is no monument more worthy of the sight,</div>
  <div class="i1">Then is the tombe of Juliet and Romeus her knight."</div>

an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head hath been<br />

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Introduction</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Metre of the Play.</span>&mdash;It should be understood at the
outset that <i>metre</i>, or the mechanism of verse, is something altogether
distinct from the <i>music</i> of verse. The one is matter of rule,
the other of taste and feeling. Music is not an absolute necessity
of verse; the metrical form is a necessity, being that which constitutes
the verse.</p>

<p>The plays of Shakespeare (with the exception of rhymed passages,
and of occasional songs and interludes) are all in unrhymed
or <i>blank</i> verse; and the normal form of this blank verse is illustrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
by the second line of the prologue to the present play:
"In fair Verona, where we lay our scene."</p>

<p>This line, it will be seen, consists of ten syllables, with the even
syllables (2d, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th) accented, the odd syllables
(1st, 3d, etc.) being unaccented. Theoretically, it is made up of
five <i>feet</i> of two syllables each, with the accent on the second syllable.
Such a foot is called an <i>iambus</i> (plural, <i>iambuses</i>, or the
Latin <i>iambi</i>), and the form of verse is called <i>iambic.</i></p>

<p>This fundamental law of Shakespeare's verse is subject to certain
modifications, the most important of which are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_1" id="LNum_Notes_1"></a>1.</span> After the tenth syllable an unaccented syllable (or even two
such syllables) may be added, forming what is sometimes called a
<i>female</i> line; as in the 103d line of the first scene: "Here were the
servants of your adversary." The rhythm is complete with the third
syllable of <a href="#Line_Notes_1"><i>adversary</i>,</a> the fourth being an extra eleventh syllable.
In iv. <a href="#Line_A4_3_27">3. 27</a> and v. <a href="#Line_A5_3_256">3. 256</a> we have two extra syllables,&mdash;the last
two of <i>Romeo</i> in both lines.
<span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_A4_3_27" id="LNum_A4_3_27"></a></span>
<span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_A5_3_256" id="LNum_A5_3_256"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_2" id="LNum_Notes_2"></a>2.</span> The accent in any part of the verse may be shifted from an
even to an odd syllable; as in line <a href="#Line_Notes_2">3</a> of the prologue, "From ancient
grudge break to new mutiny," where the accent is shifted from the
sixth to the fifth syllable. See also <a href="#Line_Notes_1_92">i. 1. 92:</a> "Canker'd with peace,
to part your canker'd hate;" where the accent is shifted from the
second to the first syllable. This change occurs very rarely in the
tenth syllable, and seldom in the fourth; and it is not allowable in
two successive accented syllables.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_3" id="LNum_Notes_3"></a>3.</span> An extra unaccented syllable may occur in any part of the
line; as in line 7 of the prologue, where the second syllable of
<a href="#Line_Pro_7"><i>piteous</i></a> is superfluous. In i. 1. 64 the third syllable of <a href="#Line_1_64"><i>Benvolio</i>,</a>
and in line 71 below the second syllable of <a href="#Line_1_71"><i>Capulets</i></a> and the second
<i>the</i> are both superfluous.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_4" id="LNum_Notes_4"></a>4.</span> Any unaccented syllable, occurring in an even place immediately
before or after an even syllable which is properly accented, is
reckoned as accented for the purposes of the verse; as, for instance,
in lines 1, 3, and 7 of the prologue. In 1 the last syllable of <a href="#Line_Pro_1"><i>dignity</i></a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
<span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_4a" id="LNum_Notes_4a"></a></span>
and in 3 the last of <a href="#Line_Pro_3"><i>mutiny</i></a> are metrically equivalent to accented
<span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_4b" id="LNum_Notes_4b"></a></span>
syllables. In 7 the same is true of the first syllable of <a href="#Line_Pro_7"><i>misadventur'd</i></a>
<span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_4c" id="LNum_Notes_4c"></a></span>
and the third of <a href="#Line_Pro_7"><i>overthrows.</i></a> In iv. 2. 18 ("Of <a href="#Line_iv_2_18">disobedient opposition</a>")
only two regular accents occur, but we have a metrical accent
<span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_4d" id="LNum_Notes_4d"></a></span>
on the first syllable of <i>disobedient</i>, and on the first and the last
syllables of <i>opposition</i>, which word has metrically five syllables. In
<i>disobedient</i> there is an extra unaccented syllable.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_5" id="LNum_Notes_5"></a>5.</span> In many instances in Shakespeare words must be <i>lengthened</i>
in order to fill out the rhythm:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_2aa" id="LNum_Notes_2aa"></a>(<i>a</i>)</span> In a large class of words in which <i>e</i> or <i>i</i> is followed by
another vowel, the <i>e</i> or <i>i</i> is made a separate syllable; as <i>ocean</i>,
<i>opinion</i>, <i>soldier</i>, <i>patience</i>, <i>partial</i>, <i>marriage</i>, etc. For instance,
iii. 5. 29 ("Some say the lark makes sweet division") appears to
have only nine syllables, but <a href="#Line_iii_5_29"><i>division</i></a> is a quadrisyllable; and so is
<a href="#Line_iv_1_41"><i>devotion</i></a> in iv. 1. 41: "God shield I should disturb devotion!"
<span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_2a" id="LNum_Notes_2a"></a></span>
<a href="#Line_iv_1_11"><i>Marriage</i></a> is a trisyllable in iv. 1. 11, and also in v. 3. 241; and the
same is true of <a href="#Line_v_1_27"><i>patience</i></a> in v. 1. 27 v. 1. 27, v. 3. 221 and 261. This lengthening
occurs most frequently at the end of the line.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_2b" id="LNum_Notes_2b"></a>(<i>b</i>)</span> Many monosyllables ending in <i>r</i>, <i>re</i>, <i>rs</i>, <i>res</i>, preceded by a
long vowel or diphthong, are often made dissyllables; as <i>fare</i>, <i>fear</i>,
<i>dear</i>, <i>fire</i>, <i>hair</i>, <i>hour</i>, <i>your</i>, etc. In iii. 1. 198: "Else, when he's
found, that hour is his last," <a href="#Line_iii_1_198"><i>hour</i></a> is a dissyllable. If the word is
repeated in a verse it is often both monosyllable and dissyllable; as
in <cite>M. of V.</cite> iii. 2. 20: "And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it
so," where either <i>yours</i> (preferably the first) is a dissyllable, the
other being a monosyllable. In <cite>J.C.</cite> iii. 1. 172: "As fire drives
fire, so pity, pity," the first <i>fire</i> is a dissyllable.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_2c" id="LNum_Notes_2c"></a>(<i>c</i>)</span> Words containing <i>l</i> or <i>r</i>, preceded by another consonant, are
often pronounced as if a vowel came between the consonants; as in
i. 4. 8: "After the prompter, at our <a href="#Line_i_4_8">entrance</a>" [ent(e)rance]. See
also <cite>T. of S.</cite> ii. 1. 158: "While she did call me rascal fiddler" [fidd(e)ler];
<cite>All's Well</cite>, iii. 5. 43: "If you will tarry, holy pilgrim"
[pilg(e)rim]; <cite>C. of E.</cite> v. 1. 360: "These are the parents of these
children" (childeren, the original form of the word); <cite>W.T.</cite> iv.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
4. 76: "Grace and remembrance [rememb(e)rance] be to you
both!" etc. See also on ii. 4. 184 and iii. 1. 89 below.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_2d" id="LNum_Notes_2d"></a>(<i>d</i>)</span> Monosyllabic exclamations (<i>ay</i>, <i>O</i>, <i>yea</i>, <i>nay</i>, <i>hail</i>, etc.) and
monosyllables otherwise emphasized are similarly lengthened; also
certain longer words; as <i>commandement</i> in <cite>M. of V.</cite> iv. 1. 442;
<i>safety</i> (trisyllable) in <cite>Ham.</cite> i. 3. 21; <i>business</i> (trisyllable, as originally
pronounced) in <cite>J.C.</cite> iv. 1. 22: "To groan and sweat under
the business" (so in several other passages); and other words
mentioned in the notes to the plays in which they occur.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_6" id="LNum_Notes_6"></a>6.</span> Words are also <i>contracted</i> for metrical reasons, like plurals
and possessives ending in a sibilant, as <i>balance</i>, <i>horse</i> (for <i>horses</i>
and <i>horse's</i>), <i>princess</i>, <i>sense</i>, <i>marriage</i> (plural and possessive),
<i>image</i>, etc. So <i>spirit</i>, <i>inter'gatories</i>, <i>unpleasant'st</i>, and other words
mentioned in the notes on the plays.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_7" id="LNum_Notes_7"></a>7.</span> The <i>accent</i> of words is also varied in many instances for metrical
reasons. Thus we find both <i>révenue</i> and <i>revénue</i> in the first
scene of the <cite>M.N.D.</cite> (lines 6 and 158), <i>óbscure</i> and <i>obscúre</i>, <i>púrsue</i>
and <i>pursúe</i>, <i>cóntrary</i> (see note on iii. 2. 64) and <i>contráry</i>,
<i>contráct</i> (see on ii. 2. 117) and <i>cóntract</i>, etc.</p>

<p>These instances of variable accent must not be confounded with
those in which words were uniformly accented differently in the
time of Shakespeare; like <i>aspéct</i>, <i>impórtune</i> (see on i. 1. 142),
<i>perséver</i> (never <i>persevére</i>), <i>perséverance</i>, <i>rheúmatic</i>, etc.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_8" id="LNum_Notes_8"></a>8.</span> <i>Alexandrines</i>, or verses of twelve syllables, with six accents,
occur here and there; as in the inscriptions on the caskets in <i>M. of
V.</i>, and occasionally in this play. They must not be confounded
with female lines with two extra syllables (see on 1 above) or with
other lines in which two extra unaccented syllables may occur.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_9" id="LNum_Notes_9"></a>9.</span> <i>Incomplete</i> verses, of one or more syllables, are scattered
through the plays. See i. 1. 61, 69, 162, 163, 164, 198, etc.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_10" id="LNum_Notes_10"></a>10.</span> <i>Doggerel</i> measure is used in the very earliest comedies
(<cite>L. L. L.</cite> and <cite>C. of E.</cite> in particular) in the mouths of comic characters,
but nowhere else in those plays, and never anywhere after
1597 or 1598. There is no instance of it in this play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_11" id="LNum_Notes_11"></a>11.</span> <i>Rhyme</i> occurs frequently in the early plays, but diminishes
with comparative regularity from that period until the latest. Thus,
in <cite>L. L. L.</cite> there are about 1100 rhyming verses (about one-third
of the whole number), in the <cite>M.N.D.</cite> about 900, and in <cite>Rich. II.</cite>
about 500, while in <cite>Cor.</cite> and <cite>A. and C.</cite> there are only about 40
each, in the <cite>Temp.</cite> only two, and in the <cite>W.T.</cite> none at all, except
in the chorus introducing act iv. Songs, interludes, and other matter
not in ten-syllable measure are not included in this enumeration.
In the present play, out of about 2500 ten-syllable verses, nearly
500 are in rhyme.</p>

<p><i>Alternate</i> rhymes are found only in the plays written before 1599
or 1600. In the <cite>M. of V.</cite> there are only four lines at the end of
iii. 2. In <cite>Much Ado</cite> and <cite>A.Y.L.</cite>, we also find a few lines, but
none at all in subsequent plays. Examples in this play are the prologue,
the chorus at the beginning of act ii., and the last speech of
act. v. See also passages in i. 2, i. 5, and v. 3.</p>

<p><i>Rhymed couplets</i> or "rhyme-tags" are often found at the end of
scenes; as in the first scene, and eleven other scenes, of the present
play. In <cite>Ham.</cite> 14 out of 20 scenes, and in <cite>Macb.</cite> 21 out of 28,
have such "tags"; but in the latest plays they are not so frequent.
The <cite>Temp</cite>., for instance, has but one, and the <cite>W.T.</cite> none.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Notes_12" id="LNum_Notes_12"></a>12.</span> In this edition of Shakespeare, the final <i>-ed</i> of past tenses
and participles is printed <i>-'d</i> when the word is to be pronounced in
the ordinary way; as in <i>star-cross'd</i>, line 6, and <i>misadventur'd</i>,
line 7, of the prologue. But when the metre requires that the <i>-ed</i>
be made a separate syllable, the <i>e</i> is retained; as in <i>moved</i>, line 85,
of the first scene, where the word is a dissyllable. The only variation
from this rule is in verbs like <i>cry</i>, <i>die</i>, <i>sue</i>, etc., the <i>-ed</i> of which
is very rarely made a separate syllable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Shakespeare's Use of Verse and Prose in the Plays.</span>&mdash;This
is a subject to which the critics have given very little attention,
but it is an interesting study. In this play we find scenes
entirely in verse (none entirely in prose) and others in which the
two are mixed. In general, we may say that verse is used for what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
is distinctly poetical, and prose for what is not poetical. The distinction,
however, is not so clearly marked in the earlier as in the
later plays. The second scene of the <cite>M. of V.</cite>, for instance, is in
prose, because Portia and Nerissa are talking about the suitors in a
familiar and playful way; but in the <cite>T.G. of V.</cite>, where Julia and
Lucetta are discussing the suitors of the former in much the same
fashion, the scene is in verse. Dowden, commenting on <cite>Rich. II.</cite>,
remarks: "Had Shakespeare written the play a few years later, we
may be certain that the gardener and his servants (iii. 4) would
not have uttered stately speeches in verse, but would have spoken
homely prose, and that humour would have mingled with the
pathos of the scene. The same remark may be made with reference
to the subsequent scene (v. 5) in which his groom visits the
dethroned king in the Tower." Comic characters and those in
low life generally speak in prose in the later plays, as Dowden
intimates, but in the very earliest ones doggerel verse is much used
instead. See on 10 above.</p>

<p>The change from prose to verse is well illustrated in the third
scene of the <cite>M. of V.</cite> It begins with plain prosaic talk about a
business matter; but when Antonio enters, it rises at once to the
higher level of poetry. The sight of Antonio reminds Shylock of
his hatred of the Merchant, and the passion expresses itself in
verse, the vernacular tongue of poetry. We have a similar change
in the first scene of <cite>J.C.</cite>, where, after the quibbling "chaff" of the
mechanics about their trades, the mention of Pompey reminds the
Tribune of their plebeian fickleness, and his scorn and indignation
flame out in most eloquent verse.</p>

<p>The reasons for the choice of prose or verse are not always so
clear as in these instances. We are seldom puzzled to explain the
prose, but not unfrequently we meet with verse where we might
expect prose. As Professor Corson remarks (<cite>Introduction to Shakespeare</cite>,
1889), "Shakespeare adopted verse as the general tenor of
his language, and therefore expressed much in verse that is within
the capabilities of prose; in other words, his verse constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
encroaches upon the domain of prose, but his prose can never be
said to encroach upon the domain of verse." If in rare instances
we think we find exceptions to this latter statement, and prose
actually seems to usurp the place of verse, I believe that careful
study of the passage will prove the supposed exception to be
apparent rather than real.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some Books for Teachers and Students.</span>&mdash;A few out of
the many books that might be commended to the teacher and the
critical student are the following: Halliwell-Phillipps's <cite>Outlines
of the Life of Shakespeare</cite> (7th ed. 1887); Sidney Lee's <cite>Life of
Shakespeare</cite> (1898; for ordinary students the abridged ed. of 1899
is preferable); Schmidt's <cite>Shakespeare Lexicon</cite> (3d ed. 1902);
Littledale's ed. of Dyce's <cite>Glossary</cite> (1902); Bartlett's <cite>Concordance
to Shakespeare</cite> (1895); Abbott's <cite>Shakespearian Grammar</cite> (1873);
Furness's "New Variorum" ed. of <cite>Romeo and Juliet</cite> (1871; encyclopædic
and exhaustive); Dowden's <cite>Shakspere: His Mind and
Art</cite> (American ed. 1881); Hudson's <cite>Life, Art, and Characters of
Shakespeare</cite> (revised ed. 1882); Mrs. Jameson's <cite>Characteristics of
Women</cite> (several eds., some with the title, <cite>Shakespeare Heroines</cite>);
Ten Brink's <cite>Five Lectures on Shakespeare</cite> (1895); Boas's <cite>Shakespeare
and His Predecessors</cite> (1895); Dyer's <cite>Folk-lore of Shakespeare</cite>
(American ed. 1884); Gervinus's <cite>Shakespeare Commentaries</cite>
(Bunnett's translation, 1875); Wordsworth's Shakespeare's <cite>Knowledge
of the Bible</cite> (3d ed. 1880); Elson's <cite>Shakespeare in Music</cite>
(1901).</p>

<p>Some of the above books will be useful to all readers who are
interested in special subjects or in general criticism of Shakespeare.
Among those which are better suited to the needs of ordinary
readers and students, the following may be mentioned: Mabie's
<cite>William Shakespeare: Poet, Dramatist, and Man</cite> (1900); Phin's
<cite>Cyclopædia and Glossary of Shakespeare</cite> (1902; more compact and
cheaper than Dyce); Dowden's <cite>Shakspere Primer</cite> (1877; small
but invaluable); Rolfe's <cite>Shakespeare the Boy</cite> (1896; treating of the
home and school life, the games and sports, the manners, customs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
and folk-lore of the poet's time); Guerber's <cite>Myths of Greece and
Rome</cite> (for young students who may need information on mythological
allusions not explained in the notes).</p>

<p>Black's <cite>Judith Shakespeare</cite> (1884; a novel, but a careful study
of the scene and the time) is a book that I always commend to
young people, and their elders will also enjoy it. The Lambs'
<cite>Tales from Shakespeare</cite> is a classic for beginners in the study of
the dramatist; and in Rolfe's ed. the plan of the authors is carried
out in the Notes by copious illustrative quotations from the plays.
Mrs. Cowden-Clarke's <cite>Girlhood of Shakespeare's Heroines</cite> (several
eds.) will particularly interest girls; and both girls and boys will
find Bennett's <cite>Master Skylark</cite> (1897) and Imogen Clark's <cite>Will
Shakespeare's Little Lad</cite> (1897) equally entertaining and instructive.</p>

<p>H. Snowden Ward's <cite>Shakespeare's Town and Times</cite> (2d ed. 1903)
and John Leyland's <cite>Shakespeare Country</cite> (enlarged ed. 1903) are
copiously illustrated books (yet inexpensive) which may be particularly
commended for school libraries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Abbreviations in the Notes.</span>&mdash;The abbreviations of the names
of Shakespeare's plays will be readily understood; as <cite>T.N.</cite> for
<cite>Twelfth Night</cite>, <cite>Cor.</cite> for <cite>Coriolanus</cite>, <cite>3 Hen. VI.</cite> for <cite>The Third
Part of King Henry the Sixth</cite>, etc. <cite>P.P.</cite> refers to <cite>The Passionate
Pilgrim</cite>; <cite>V. and A.</cite> to <cite>Venus and Adonis</cite>; <cite>L.C.</cite> to <cite>Lover's Complaint</cite>;
and Sonn. to the <cite>Sonnets</cite>.</p>

<p>Other abbreviations that hardly need explanation are <i>Cf.</i> (<i>confer</i>,
compare), <i>Fol.</i> (following), <cite>Id.</cite> (<i>idem</i>, the same), and <i>Prol.</i> (prologue).
The numbers of the lines in the references (except for the
present play) are those of the "Globe" edition (the cheapest and
best edition of <cite>Shakespeare</cite> in one compact volume), which is now
generally accepted as the standard for line-numbers in works of reference
(Schmidt's <cite>Lexicon</cite>, Abbott's <cite>Grammar</cite>, Dowden's <cite>Primer</cite>,
the publications of the New Shakspere Society, etc.). Every
teacher and every critical student should have it at hand for
reference.</p>

According to Nares, the phrase got this meaning from the fact that

though one is no number. The quibble at the end alludes to the

a number one is reckon'd none." Dowden points thus: "Which
on more view of, many&mdash;mine being one&mdash;May," etc., and explains
thus: "On more view of whom (that is, the lady of most
merit), many (other ladies)&mdash;and my daughter among them&mdash;may
stand in a count of heads, but in estimation (<i>reckoning</i>, with
a play on the word) none can hold a place." The general sense
of the passage is clear, whatever reading or analysis we adopt.

whom you like best of the beauties gathered there; if Juliet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>

says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"She is drawn with the most wonderful power and discrimination. In the
prosaic homeliness of the outline, and the magical illusion of the
colouring, she reminds us of some of the marvellous Dutch paintings,
from which, with all their coarseness, we start back as from a reality.
Her low humour, her shallow garrulity, mixed with the dotage and
petulance of age&mdash;her subserviency, her secrecy, and her total want
of elevated principle, or even common honesty&mdash;are brought before
us like a living and palpable truth....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>"Among these harsh and inferior spirits is Juliet placed; her haughty
parents, and her plebeian nurse, not only throw into beautiful relief
her own native softness and elegance, but are at once the cause and the
excuse of her subsequent conduct. She trembles before her stern mother
and her violent father, but, like a petted child, alternately cajoles
and commands her nurse. It is her old foster-mother who is the
confidante of her love. It is the woman who cherished her infancy who
aids and abets her in her clandestine marriage. Do we not perceive how
immediately our impression of Juliet's character would have been
lowered, if Shakespeare had placed her in connection with any
commonplace dramatic waiting-woman?&mdash;even with Portia's adroit
Nerissa, or Desdemona's Emilia? By giving her the Nurse for her
confidante, the sweetness and dignity of Juliet's character are
preserved inviolate to the fancy, even in the midst of all the romance
and wilfulness of passion."</p>

<p>Cf. Coleridge: "The character of the Nurse is the nearest of anything in
Shakspeare to a direct borrowing from mere observation; and the reason
is, that as in infancy and childhood the individual in nature is a
representative of a class&mdash;just as in describing one larch-tree,
you generalize a grove of them&mdash;so it is nearly as much so in old
age. The generalization is done to the poet's hand. Here you have the
garrulity of age strengthened by the feelings of a long-trusted servant,
whose sympathy with the mother's affections gives her privileges and
rank in the household; and observe the mode of connection by accidents
of time and place, and the childlike fondness of repetition in a second
childhood, and also that happy, humble ducking under, yet constant
resurgence against, the check of her superiors!"</p>

woman of loose life, checks herself&mdash;<i>God forbid</i> her darling should

</div>

<p>In Paynter's <cite>Palace of Pleasure</cite> he is spoken of as "an other Gentleman
called <i>Mercutio</i>, which was a courtlyke Gentleman, very well beloued of
all men, and by reason of his pleasaunt and curteous behauior was in
euery company wel intertayned." His "audacity among Maydens" and his
cold hands are also mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Act1Sc4_1" id="LNum_Act1Sc4_1"></a>1.</span> <a href="#Line_Act1Sc4_1"><i>This speech.</i></a> Furness would read "the speech"; but, as the
scene opens in the midst of the conversation, S. may have meant to
imply that some one in the company has suggested an introductory
speech. See the following note.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Act1Sc4_3" id="LNum_Act1Sc4_3"></a>3.</span> <a href="#Line_Act1Sc4_3"><i>The date is out</i>,</a> etc. That is, such tediousness is now out of
fashion. Steevens remarks: "In <cite>Henry VIII.</cite> where the king introduces
himself to the entertainment given by Wolsey [i. 4] he
appears, like Romeo and his companions, in a <i>mask</i>, and sends a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
messenger before to make an apology for his intrusion. This was
a custom observed by those who came uninvited, with a desire to
conceal themselves for the sake of intrigue, or to enjoy the greater
freedom of conversation. Their entry on these occasions was always
prefaced by some speech in praise of the beauty of the ladies
or the generosity of the entertainer; and to the <i>prolixity</i> of such
introductions I believe Romeo is made to allude. So in <i>Histrio-mastix</i>,
1610, a man expresses his wonder that the maskers enter
without any compliment: 'What, come they in so blunt, without
device?' In the accounts of many entertainments given in reigns
antecedent to that of Elizabeth, I find this custom preserved. Of
the same kind of masquerading see a specimen in <cite>T. of A.</cite> [i. 2],
where Cupid precedes a troop of ladies with a speech." Collier
compares <cite>L. L. L.</cite> v. 2. 158 fol.</p>

  <div class="i0">And sayde, 'sires, what? Dun is in the myre.'"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gifford explains the expression thus: "<i>Dun in the mire</i> is a Christmas
gambol, at which I have often played. A log of wood is brought
into the midst of the room: this is <i>Dun</i> (the cart-horse), and a cry
is raised that he is <i>stuck in the mire</i>. Two of the company advance,
either with or without ropes, to draw him out. After repeated
attempts, they find themselves unable to do it, and call for more
assistance. The game continues till all the company take part in
it, when Dun is extricated of course; and the merriment arises
from the awkward and affected efforts of the rustics to lift the log,
and from sundry arch contrivances to let the ends of it fall on one
another's toes. This will not be thought a very exquisite amusement;
and yet I have seen much honest mirth at it." Halliwell-Phillipps
quotes <cite>Westward Hoe</cite>, 1607: "I see I'm born still to
draw dun out o' th' mire for you; that wise beast will I be;" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Butler, <i>Remains</i>: "they meant to leave reformation, like Dun in

improper. Cf. <cite>C. of E.</cite> iii. 2. 93: "such a one as a man may not

the horses' manes, thereby plaiting them in inextricable knots, to the
great annoyance of the poor animals and vexation of their masters. These

in a sieve over the fire, beate them in a stone mortar, and when they be
small mix them with two pounde of sugar beeing finely beaten, adding two
or three spoonefuls of rosewater, and that will keep your almonds from
oiling: when your paste is beaten fine, drive it thin with a rowling
pin, and so lay it on a bottom of wafers, then raise up a little edge on
the side, and so bake it, then yce it with rosewater and sugar, then put
it in the oven againe, and when you see your yce is risen up and drie,
then take it out of the oven and garnish it with pretie conceipts, as
birdes and beasts being cast out of standing moldes. Sticke long comfits
upright in it, cast bisket and carrowaies in it, and so serve it; guild
it before you serve it: you may also print of this <i>marchpane</i> paste in
your molds for banqueting dishes. And of this paste our comfit makers at
this day make their letters, knots, armes, escutcheons, beasts, birds,
and other fancies." Castles and other figures were often made of
marchpane, to decorate splendid desserts, and were demolished by
shooting or throwing sugar-plums at them. Cf. Beaumont and Fletcher,

by many editors. The quartos and 1st folio have "It seemes she
hangs." As Verplanck remarks, it is quite probable that the correction
was the poet's own, obtained from some other MS. altered
during the poet's life; it is besides confirmed by the repetition of
<i>beauty</i> in 49. Delius, who retains <i>it seems</i>, thinks that the boldness
of the simile led the poet to introduce it in that way; but it is
Romeo who is speaking, and the simile is not over-bold for him.

<p>White remarks: "I have never seen a Juliet on the stage who appeared to
appreciate the archness of the dialogue with Romeo in this scene. They
go through it solemnly, or at best with staid propriety. They reply
literally to all Romeo's speeches about saints and palmers. But it
should be noticed that though this is the first interview of the lovers,
we do not hear them speak until the close of their dialogue, in which
they have arrived at a pretty thorough understanding of their mutual
feeling. Juliet makes a feint of parrying Romeo's advances, but does it
archly, and knows that he is to have the kiss he sues for. He asks,
'Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?' The stage Juliet answers
with literal solemnity. But it was not a conventicle at old Capulet's.
Juliet was not holding forth. How demure is her real answer: 'Ay,
pilgrim, lips that they must use&mdash;in prayer!' And when Romeo fairly
gets her into the corner, towards which she has been contriving to be
driven, and he says, 'Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd,'
and does put them to that purgation, how slyly the pretty puss gives him
the opportunity to repeat the penance by replying, 'Then have my lips
the sin that they have took!'"</p>

"Abraham: Cupid;" the other early eds. "Abraham Cupid." Upton
conjectured "Adam Cupid," with an allusion to the famous
archer, Adam Bell, and was followed by Steevens and others.
Theobald suggested "auborn," and it has since been shown that
<i>abraham</i>, <i>abram</i>, <i>aborne</i>, <i>aborn</i>, <i>abron</i>, <i>aubrun</i>, etc., were all forms
of the word now written <i>auburn</i>. In <cite>Cor.</cite> ii. 3. 21 the 1st, 2d, and
3d folios read: "our heads are some browne, some blacke, some Abram,
some bald;" the 4th folio changes "Abram" to "auburn." In <cite>T.G. of V.</cite>
iv. 4. 194, the folio has "Her haire is <i>Aburne</i>, mine is perfect
<i>Yellow</i>." These are the only instances of the word in S. "Auburn" is
adopted by a few editors, and is explained as = "auburn-haired," but
that surely is no <i>nickname</i>. Schmidt understands "Young Abraham Cupid"
to be used "in derision of the eternal boyhood of Cupid, though in fact
he was at least as old as father Abraham." Cf. <cite>L. L. L.</cite> iii. 1. 182:
"This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;" and <cite>Id.</cite> v. 2. 10: "For
he hath been five thousand years a boy." Furness in his Variorum ed.
gives "Adam," but he now prefers "Abraham" = the young counterfeit, with
his sham make-up, pretending to be <i>purblind</i> and yet <i>shooting so
trim</i>. He thinks the allusion to the <i>beggar-maid</i> also favours this
explanation. <i>Abraham-man</i>, originally applied to a mendicant lunatic
from Bethlehem Hospital, London, came to be a cant term for an impostor
wandering about and asking alms under pretence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> of lunacy.
Herford says that "Adam" is made almost certain by <cite>Much Ado</cite>, i. 1.
260; but it is by no means certain that the allusion there is to Adam
Bell, as he assumes.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Act2Sc1_13a" id="LNum_Act2Sc1_13a"></a></span> <a href="#Line_Act2Sc1_13a"><i>Trim.</i></a> The reading of 1st quarto; the other early eds. have "true."
That the former is the right word is evident from the ballad of <cite>King

read:&mdash;</p>

the latter for the servant. Mercutio uses the term in sport, and
adds a quibble on <i>field-bed</i>, which was a camp-bed, or a bed on

Cambridge ed. suggests that in the old arrangement of the scene the wall
may have been represented as dividing the stage, so that the audience
could see Romeo on one side and Mercutio on the other. Mr. F.A. Marshall
thinks that Romeo "merely stepped to the back of the stage at the
beginning of the scene, and was supposed to be concealed from the
others, not coming out till they had gone. Juliet would appear on the
'upper stage' [the balcony at the back of the Elizabethan stage], which
did duty in the old plays for so many purposes."</p>

in proof that blue eyes were accounted ugly; but the reference
there, as in <cite>A.Y.L.</cite> iii. 2. 393 ("a blue eye and sunken"), seems
to be to a bluish circle about the eyes. It is curious that these are
the only specific allusions to blue eyes in S. In <cite>W.T.</cite> i. 2. 136,
some make "welkin eye" = blue eye; but it is more probably =
heavenly eye, as Schmidt gives it. In <cite>V. and A.</cite> 482 ("Her two
blue windows faintly she upheaveth") the eyelids, not the eyes, are
meant, on account of their "blue veins" (<cite>R. of L.</cite> 440). Cf. <cite>Cymb.</cite>

<p>Malone cites both this last passage and <cite>V. and A.</cite> 482 as referring
to blue eyes; but the "azure <i>lac'd</i>" ought to settle the question in
regard to the former, and "windows" evidently has the same
meaning in both. If the "blue windows" <i>were</i> blue eyes, Malone
would make out his case, for in <cite>V. and A.</cite> 140 the goddess says
"Mine eyes are grey and bright." But why should the poet call
them <i>blue</i> in the one place and <i>grey</i> in the other, when the former
word would suit the verse equally well in both? In my opinion,
when he says <i>blue</i> he means blue, and when he says <i>grey</i> he means
grey. See on ii. 3. 1 above. The <cite>New Eng. Dict.</cite> does not recognize
blue as a meaning of <i>grey</i>. It seems, however, from certain
passages in writers of the time that the word was sometimes =
bluish grey or bluish; but never "bright blue" (as Delius defines
it) or clear blue, as Dyce and others assume.</p>

the 1st quarto, "So light a foot ne'er hurts the trodden flower," is
"a daintier and more graceful, and therefore, it would seem, a more

figure, which has been used by the poets from Pope's description
of Camilla flying "o'er the unbending corn" to Tennyson's Olivia

<p>It would be appropriate in the Friar's mouth if he were in the
fields, as in ii. 3, and Juliet had met him there. Very likely S. at
first wrote it as in the quarto, but his poetic instinct led him to
change it in revising the play. The speaker is now in his cell, with
its stone floor worn by the tread of many heavy feet&mdash;such as one
sees in old churches and monasteries in Europe&mdash;but Juliet's light
step will not thus wear "the everlasting flint." The comparison is

like this. The condensed summary of the comments upon it
fills twenty-eight octavo pages of fine print in Furness, to which
I must refer the curious reader. The early eds. have "runnawayes,"
"run-awayes," "run-awaies," or "run-aways." Those who
retain this as a possessive singular refer it variously to Ph&oelig;bus,
Phaethon, Cupid, Night, the sun, the moon, Romeo, and Juliet;
those who make it a possessive plural generally understand it to
mean persons running about the streets at night. No one of the
former list of interpretations is at all satisfactory. Personally, I am
quite well satisfied to read <i>runaways'</i>, and to accept the explanation
given by Hunter and adopted by Delius, Schmidt, Daniel, and
others. It is the simplest possible solution, and is favoured by the
<i>untalk'd of</i> that follows. White objects to it that "<i>runaway</i> seems
to have been used only to mean one who ran away, and that <i>runagate</i>,
which had the same meaning then that it has now, would have
suited the verse quite as well as <i>runaway</i>;" but, as Furnivall and
others have noted, Cotgrave apparently uses <i>runaway</i> and <i>runagate</i>
as nearly equivalent terms. In a letter in the <cite>Academy</cite> for
Nov. 30, 1878, Furnivall, after referring to his former citations in
favour of <i>runaways</i> = "runagates, runabouts," and to the fact
that Ingleby and Schmidt have since given the same interpretation,
adds, "But I still desire to cite an instance in which Shakspere
himself renders Holinshed's 'runagates' by his own 'runaways.'
In the second edition of Holinshed's <cite>Chronicle</cite>, 1587, which Shakspere
used for his <cite>Richard III.</cite>, he found the passage (p. 756, col.
2): 'You see further, how a company of traitors, thieves, outlaws,
and <i>runagates</i>, be aiders and partakers of this feate and enterprise,'
etc. And he turned it thus into verse (1st folio, p. 203):&mdash;</p>

<p>Herford regards this interpretation as "a prosaic idea;" but
it seems to me perfectly in keeping with the character and the
situation. The marriage was a secret one, and Juliet would not
have Romeo, if seen, supposed to be a paramour visiting her by
night. She knows also the danger he incurs if detected by her
kinsmen. Cf. ii. 2. 64 fol. above.</p>

'Come, Night, come, Romeo, <i>come thou day in night</i>!'
expresses that fulness of enthusiastic admiration for her lover which
possesses her whole soul; but expresses it as only Juliet could or
would have expressed it&mdash;in a bold and beautiful metaphor. Let
it be remembered that, in this speech, Juliet is not supposed to be
addressing an audience, nor even a confidante; and I confess I
have been shocked at the utter want of taste and refinement in
those who, with coarse derision, or in a spirit of prudery, yet more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
gross and perverse, have dared to comment on this beautiful
'Hymn to the Night,' breathed out by Juliet in the silence and
solitude of her chamber. She is thinking aloud; it is the young
heart 'triumphing to itself in words.' In the midst of all the vehemence
with which she calls upon the night to bring Romeo to her
arms, there is something so almost infantine in her perfect simplicity,
so playful and fantastic in the imagery and language, that the
charm of sentiment and innocence is thrown over the whole; and
her impatience, to use her own expression, is truly that of 'a child
before a festival, that hath new robes and may not wear them.' It
is at the very moment too that her whole heart and fancy are
abandoned to blissful anticipation that the Nurse enters with the
news of Romeo's banishment; and the immediate transition from
rapture to despair has a most powerful effect."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jameson remarks on this passage: "This highly figurative
and antithetical exuberance of language is defended by Schlegel on
strong and just grounds; and to me also it appears natural, however
critics may argue against its taste or propriety. The warmth
and vivacity of Juliet's fancy, which plays like a light over every part
of her character&mdash;which animates every line she utters&mdash;which
kindles every thought into a picture, and clothes her emotions in
visible images, would naturally, under strong and unusual excitement,
and in the conflict of opposing sentiments, run into some
extravagance of diction." Cf. i. 1. 168 fol. above.</p>

<p><span class="lnreturn"><a name="LNum_Act3Sc5" id="LNum_Act3Sc5"></a></span> <a href="#Line_Act3Sc5"><i>Juliet's Chamber.</i></a> The scene is variously given by
the editors as "The Garden," "Anti-room of Juliet's Chamber,"
"Loggia to Juliet's Chamber," "An open Gallery to Juliet's Chamber
overlooking the Orchard," "Juliet's Bedchamber; a Window
open upon the Balcony," "Capulet's Orchard," etc. As Malone
remarks, Romeo and Juliet probably appeared in the balcony at
the rear of the old English stage. "The scene in the poet's eye
was doubtless the large and massy projecting balcony before one or
more windows, common in Italian palaces and not unfrequent in
Gothic civil architecture. The <i>loggia</i>, an open gallery, or high
terrace [see cut on p. 85], communicating with the upper apartments
of a palace, is a common feature in Palladian architecture,
and would also be well adapted to such a scene" (Verplanck).</p>

and sings upon the same tree for many weeks together (Steevens).
This is because the male bird sings near where the female is sitting.
"The preference of the nightingale for the <i>pomegranate</i> is unquestionable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
'The nightingale sings from the pomegranate groves
in the daytime,' says Russel in his account of Aleppo. A friend ... informs
us that throughout his journeys in the East he never
heard such a choir of nightingales as in a row of pomegranate-trees
that skirt the road from Smyrna to Boudjia" (Knight).</p>

education and habits: we see her, on the one hand, kept in severe
subjection by her austere parents; and, on the other, fondled and
spoiled by a foolish old nurse&mdash;a situation perfectly accordant with
the manners of the time. Then Lady Capulet comes sweeping by
with her train of velvet, her black hood, her fan, and rosary&mdash;the
very beau-ideal of a proud Italian matron of the fifteenth century,
whose offer to poison Romeo, in revenge for the death of Tybalt,
stamps her with one very characteristic trait of the age and the
country. Yet she loves her daughter, and there is a touch of
remorseful tenderness in her lamentations over her, which adds to

from previous inactivity, by desperate love and grief, into self-conscious
strength, would instinctively use. Especially are they
exactly the sort of shifts and quibbles that a nature rendered timid
by stinted intercourse with her kind, and by communion limited to

<p>Mrs. Jameson remarks: "The old woman, true to her vocation,
and fearful lest her share in these events should be discovered,
counsels her to forget Romeo and marry Paris; and the moment
which unveils to Juliet the weakness and baseness of her confidante
is the moment which reveals her to herself. She does not
break into upbraidings; it is no moment for anger; it is incredulous
amazement, succeeded by the extremity of scorn and abhorrence,
which takes possession of her mind. She assumes at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>

to me an admirable touch of nature, considering the master-passion
which, at this moment, rules in Juliet's soul, that she is as much
shocked by the nurse's dispraise of her lover as by her wicked, time-serving
advice. This scene is the crisis in the character; and
henceforth we see Juliet assume a new aspect. The fond, impatient,
timid girl puts on the wife and the woman: she has learned heroism
from suffering, and subtlety from oppression. It is idle to
criticise her dissembling submission to her father and mother; a
higher duty has taken place of that which she owed to them; a
more sacred tie has severed all others. Her parents are pictured
as they are, that no feeling for them may interfere in the slightest
degree with our sympathy for the lovers. In the mind of Juliet
there is no struggle between her filial and her conjugal duties, and
there ought to be none."</p>

before noon, it is sometimes celebrated in the evening

which is more in accordance with the dates given in the
play. In iv. 1. 90 the Friar says to Juliet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i7">"<i>Wednesday</i> is to-morrow:</div>
  <div class="i0">To-morrow night look that thou lie alone," etc.</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This agrees with the preceding dates. The conversation in iii. 4 is
late on Monday evening (cf. lines 5 and 18), and Lady Capulet's
talk with Juliet about marrying Paris (iii. 5. 67 fol.) is early the
next (Tuesday) morning. The visit to the Friar is evidently on the
same day; and the next scene (iv. 2) is in the evening of that day.
Juliet comes home and tells her father that she has been to the
Friar's, and is ready to marry Paris. The old man at once decides
to have the wedding "to-morrow morning" (that is, Wednesday)
instead of Thursday. Lady Capulet objects, but finally yields to
her husband's persistency; and so Juliet goes to her chamber, and
drinks the potion on <i>Tuesday</i> evening, or twenty-four hours earlier
than the Friar had directed. He of course is notified of the change
in the time for the wedding, as he is to perform the ceremony, and
will understand that Juliet has anticipated the time of taking the
potion, and that she will wake on <i>Thursday</i> morning instead of
Friday. If so, instead of extending the "two and forty hours," as
Maginn does, we need rather to shorten the interval. We may
suppose the time of v. 3 to be as early as three o'clock in the
morning. It is summer, and before daylight. Paris and Romeo
come with torches, and the Friar with a lantern. Romeo tells his
servant to deliver the letter to his father "early in the morning."
The night watchmen are still on duty. Since we can hardly send
Juliet to bed before nine in the evening on Tuesday, <i>thirty</i> hours is
the most that can be allowed for the interval, unless we add another
day and accept the fifty-two of Maginn. But this does not seem
required by anything in act v.&mdash;not even by the "two days buried"
of v. 3. 176, for Thursday would be the second day that she had
lain in the tomb. The marriage was to be early on Wednesday
morning, and the funeral took its place. Balthasar "presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
took post" (v. 1. 21) to tell the news to Romeo at Mantua, less
than twenty-five miles distant. He arrives before evening (cf. v.
1. 4: "all this day," which indicates the time), and Romeo at once
says, "I will hence <i>to-night</i>." He has ample time to make his
preparations and to reach Verona before two o'clock the next
morning. He has been at the tomb only half an hour or so (v.
3. 130) before the Friar comes. It must have been near midnight
(see v. 2. 23) when Friar John returned to Laurence's cell; so that,
even if he had not been despatched to Mantua until that morning,
he would have had time to go and return, but for his unexpected
detention. I see no difficulty, therefore, in assuming that the drama
closes on Thursday morning; the difficulty would be in prolonging
the time to the next morning without making the action drag.</p>

<p>that is, what fowl is under the crust of the pie. <i>Good Angelica</i>

Lady Capulet; on the ground that the Nurse is not present, having
been sent for spices. It has also been suggested that a servant

case for a musical instrument); as in <cite>W.T.</cite> iv. 4. 844: "but

played the part of Peter, as he did that of Dogberry in <cite>Much Ado</cite>.</p>

<p>In explanation of the introduction of this part of the scene,
Knight remarks: "It was the custom of our ancient theatre to
introduce, in the irregular pauses of a play that stood in place of a
division into acts, some short diversions, such as a song, a dance,
or the extempore buffoonery of a clown. At this point of <cite>R. and J.</cite>
there is a natural pause in the action, and at this point such an
interlude would probably have been presented, whether S. had
written one or not.... Will Kempe was the Liston of his day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
and was as great a popular favourite as Tarleton had been before
him. It was wise, therefore, in S. to find some business for Will
Kempe that should not be entirely out of harmony with the great
business of his play. The scene of the musicians is very short, and,
regarded as a necessary part of the routine of the ancient stage, is
excellently managed. Nothing can be more naturally exhibited
than the indifference of hirelings, without attachment, to a family
scene of grief. Peter and the musicians bandy jokes; and though
the musicians think Peter a 'pestilent knave,' perhaps for his
inopportune sallies, they are ready enough to look after their own
gratification, even amidst the sorrow which they see around them.
A wedding or a burial is the same to them. 'Come, we'll in here;
tarry for the mourners, and stay dinner.' So S. read the course of
the world&mdash;and it is not much changed."</p>

<p>"To our minds," says Clarke, "the intention was to show how
grief and gayety, pathos and absurdity, sorrow and jesting, elbow
each other in life's crowd; how the calamities of existence fall
heavily upon the souls of some, while others, standing close beside
the grievers, feel no jot of suffering or sympathy. Far from the
want of harmony that has been found here, we feel it to be one of
those passing discords that produce richest and fullest effect of
harmonious contrivance."</p>

<p>Furness states that in Edwin Booth's acting copy this scene of
Peter and the musicians is transposed to i. 5. 17 above.</p>

impossible to say what is the joke in <i>give you the minstrel</i>. Some
suppose that <i>gleek</i> suggests <i>gleeman</i>, one form of which in Anglo-Saxon
was <i>gligman</i>, but no such form is found in English, if we may
trust the <cite>New Eng. Dict.</cite> The reply of the musician may perhaps
mean "that he will retort by calling Peter the servant to the minstrel"

21 above. Secret poisoning became so common in Europe in the
16th century that laws against the sale of poisons were made in
Spain, Portugal, Italy, and other countries. Knight says: "There
is no such law in our own statute-book; and the circumstance is a
remarkable exemplification of the difference between English and
Continental manners." But that this practice of poisoning prevailed
to a considerable extent in England in the olden time is evident
from the fact that in the 21st year of the reign of Henry VIII.
an act was passed declaring the employment of secret poisons to
be high-treason, and sentencing those who were found guilty of it
to be boiled to death.</p>

that of all-seizing, or "taking the whole," as Schmidt explains it.</p>

who rarely makes such a slip, treats both of these examples as literal
rather than metaphorical. The only example of the former
sense in S. (not really his) is <cite>Per.</cite> ii. 3. 31: "All viands that I eat

omen is very ancient. Cicero mentions it in his <cite>De Divinatione</cite>.
Melton, in his <cite>Astrologaster</cite>, 1620, says that "if a man stumbles in a
morning as soon as he comes out of dores, it is a signe of ill lucke."
Bishop Hall, in his <cite>Characters</cite>, says of the "Superstitious Man" that
"if he stumbled at the threshold, he feares a mischief." Stumbling
at graves is alluded to in <cite>Whimzies, or a New Cast of Characters</cite>,
1631: "His earth-reverting body (according to his mind) is to be
buried in some cell, roach, or vault, and in no open space, lest
passengers (belike) might stumble on his grave." Steevens cites
3 <cite>Hen. VI.</cite> iv. 7. 11 and <cite>Rich. III.</cite> iii. 4. 86.</p>

"What happens to a person under the manifest influence of fear

seems to me more likely that the man confuses what he saw while
half asleep with what he might have dreamt.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX"></a>APPENDIX</h2>

<p class="p1"><a name="CONCERNING_ARTHUR_BROOKE" id="CONCERNING_ARTHUR_BROOKE"></a><span class="smcap">Concerning Arthur Brooke</span></p>


<p>Little is known of the life of Arthur Broke, or Brooke, except
that he wrote <cite>Romeus and Juliet</cite> (1562) and the next year published
a book entitled <i>Agreement of Sundry Places of Scripture,
seeming in shew to jarre, serving in stead of Commentaryes not
only for these, but others lyke</i>; a translation from the French. He
died that same year (1563), and an <cite>Epitaph</cite> by George Turbervile
(printed in a volume of his poems, 1567) "on the death of maister
Arthur Brooke" informs us that he was "drowned in passing to
Newhaven."</p>

<p>So far as I am aware, no editor or commentator has referred to
the singular prose introduction to the 1562 edition of <cite>Romeus and
Juliet</cite>. It is clear from internal evidence that it was written by
Brooke, and it is signed "Ar. Br."&mdash;the form in which his name
also appears on the title-page; but its tone and spirit are strangely
unlike those of the poem. We have seen (p. 25 above) that he
refers to the perpetuation of "the memory of so perfect, sound,
and so approved love" by the "stately tomb" of Romeo and
Juliet, with "great store of cunning epitaphs in honour of their
death;" but in the introduction he expresses a very different opinion
of the lovers and finds a very different lesson in their fate.
He says: "To this end (good Reader) is this tragical matter
written, to describe unto thee a couple of unfortunate lovers, thralling
themselves to unhonest desire, neglecting the authority and
advice of parents and friends, conferring their principal counsels
with drunken gossips and superstitious friars (the naturally fit instruments
of unchastity), attempting all adventures of peril for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
attaining of their wicked lusts, using auricular confession (the key
of whoredom and treason) for furtherance of their purpose, abusing
the honourable name of lawful marriage to cloak the shame of
stolen contracts; finally, by all means of unhonest life, hasting to
most unhappy death." The suggestion is added that parents may
do well to show the poem to their children with "the intent to
raise in them an hateful loathing of so filthy beastliness."</p>

<p>It is curious that there is not the slightest hint of all this anywhere
in the poem; not a suggestion that the love of Romeo and
Juliet is not natural and pure and honest; not a word of reproach
for the course of Friar Laurence. Even the picture of the Nurse,
with her vulgarity and unscrupulousness, is drawn with a kind of
humour.</p>

<p>I have quoted above (note on ii. 2. 142) what Brooke makes
Juliet say to her lover in the balcony scene. In their first interview,
she says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"You are no more your owne (deare frend) then I am yours</div>
  <div class="i0">(My honor saved) prest tobay [to obey] your will while life endures.</div>
  <div class="i0">Lo here the lucky lot that sild [seldom] true lovers finde:</div>
  <div class="i0">Eche takes away the others hart, and leaves the owne behinde.</div>
  <div class="i0">A happy life is love if God graunt from above</div>
  <div class="i0">That hart with hart by even waight doo make exchaunge of love."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And Romeo has just said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">

  <div class="i0">"For I of God woulde crave, as pryse of paynes forpast,</div>

  <div class="i0">A secret and assured frend unto the Montegue."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the end of the tragic story the poet asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"But now what shall betyde of this gray-bearded syre?</div>
  <div class="i0">Of fryer Lawrence thus araynde, that good barefooted fryre?</div>

  <div class="i0">Till that from earth to heaven his heavenly sprite dyd flye:</div>
  <div class="i0">Fyve yeres he lived an Hermite, and an Hermite dyd he dye."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The puzzling prose preface to the poem is followed, in the original
edition, by another in verse, similarly headed "To the Reader,"
from which we learn that Brooke had written other poems, which
with this he compares to unlicked whelps&mdash;"nought els but
lumpes of fleshe withouten heare" (hair)&mdash;but <i>this</i> poem, he
says, is "the eldest of them" and his "youthfull woorke." He
has decided to publish it, but "The rest (unlickt as yet) a whyle
shall lurke" (that is, in manuscript)&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Till tyme give strength to meete and match in fight</div>
  <div class="i0">With slaunders whelpes."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I suspect that after this poem was written he had become a Puritan,&mdash;or
more rigid in his Puritanism,&mdash;but nevertheless lusted after
literary fame and could not resist the temptation to publish the
"youthfull woorke." But after writing the verse prologue it occurred
to him&mdash;or some of his godly friends may have admonished
him&mdash;that the character of the story and the manner in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
he had treated it, needed further apology or justification; and the
prose preface was written to serve as a kind of "moral" to the production.
After the suggestion to parents quoted above he adds:
"Hereunto if you applye it, ye shall <i>deliver my dooing from offence</i>,
and profit your selves. Though I saw the same argument lately set
foorth on stage with more commendation then I can looke for
(being there much better set forth then I have or can dooe) yet
the same matter penned as it is, may serve to lyke good effect, if
the readers do brynge with them lyke good myndes, to consider it,
which hath the more incouraged me to publishe it, such as it is."</p>

<p>The reader may be surprised that Brooke refers to having seen
the story "on stage;" but the Puritans did not altogether disapprove
of plays that had a moral purpose. It will be remembered
that Stephen Gosson, in his <cite>Schoole of Abuse</cite> (1579), excepts a few
plays from the sweeping condemnation of his "plesaunt invective
against Poets, Pipers, Plaiers, Jesters, and such like caterpillers of
a Commonwelth"&mdash;among them being "<i>The Jew</i>,... representing
the greedinesse of worldly chusers, and the bloody minds of
usurers," which may have anticipated Shakespeare in combining
the stories of the caskets and the pound of flesh in <cite>The Merchant
of Venice</cite>.</p>

<p>That Brooke was a Puritan we may infer from the religious character
of the only other book (mentioned above) which he is known
to have published. His death the same year probably prevented
his carrying out the intention of licking the rest of his poetical
progeny into shape for print.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Juliet.</span>&mdash;Juliet is not fortunate in her parents. Her father is
sixty or more years old (as we may infer from what he says in
i. 5. 29 fol.), while her mother is about twenty-eight (see i. 3. 50),
and must have been married when she was half that age. Her
assertion that Juliet was born when she herself was "much upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
these years" of her daughter (who will be fourteen in about a fortnight,
as the Nurse informs us in the same scene) is somewhat indefinite,
but must be within a year or two of the exact figure. Her
marriage was evidently a worldly one, arranged by her parents with
little or no regard for her own feelings, much as she and her husband
propose to marry Juliet to Paris.</p>

<p>We may infer that Capulet had not been married before, though,
as he himself intimates and the lady declares (iv. 4. 11 fol.), he
had been a "mouse-hunt" (given to flirtation and intrigue) in his
bachelor days; and she thinks that he needs "watching" even
now, lest he give her occasion for jealousy.</p>

<p>Neither father nor mother seems to have any marked affection
for Juliet, or any interest in her welfare except to get her off their
hands by what, from their point of view, is a desirable marriage.
Capulet says (iii. 5. 175):&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"God's bread! it makes me mad! Day, night, late, early,</div>
  <div class="i0">At home, abroad, alone, in company,</div>
  <div class="i0">Waking, or sleeping, still my care hath been</div>
  <div class="i0">To have her match'd; and having now provided</div>
  <div class="i0">A gentleman of noble parentage,</div>
  <div class="i0">Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,</div>
  <div class="i0">Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,</div>
  <div class="i0">Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man,&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">And then to have a wretched puling fool,</div>
  <div class="i0">A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,</div>
  <div class="i0">To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,</div>
  <div class="i0">I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'"</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is more than he can endure; and his wife, when Juliet begs her
to interpose and "delay the marriage for a month, a week," refuses
to "speak a word" in opposition to his determination to let her
"die in the streets" if she does not marry Paris that very week.
"Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee," the Lady adds, and
leaves the hapless girl to her despair. A moment before she had
said, "I would the fool were married to her grave!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Earlier in the play (i. 2. 16) Capulet has said to Paris:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,</div>
  <div class="i0">My will to her consent is but a part;</div>
  <div class="i0">An she agree, within her scope of choice,</div>
  <div class="i0">Lies my consent and fair according voice;"&mdash;</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>but from the context we see that this is merely a plausible excuse
for not giving the count a definite answer just then. The girl, he
says, is "yet a stranger in the world" (has not yet "come out," in
modern parlance), and it is best to wait a year or two:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"Let two more summers wither in their pride</div>
  <div class="i0">Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He sees no reason for haste; but later, influenced by the noble
wooer's importunities and the persuasions of his wife, who has
favoured an early marriage from the first (i. 3), he takes a different
tone (iii. 4. 12):&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"<i>Capulet.</i> Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender</div>
  <div class="i0">Of my child's love. I think she will be rul'd</div>
  <div class="i0">In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;</div>
  <div class="i0">Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love,</div>
  <div class="i0">And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next&mdash;</div>
  <div class="i0">But, soft! what day is this?</div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i>Paris.</i> <span style="margin-left: 7em;">Monday, my lord.</span></div>
 </div>
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><i>Capulet.</i> Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.</div>
  <div class="i0">O' Thursday let it be; o' Thursday, tell her,</div>
  <div class="i0">She shall be married to this noble earl."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"She <i>shall</i> be married," and the day is fixed. Already he calls
Paris "my son." No question now of delay, and getting her "consent"
as a condition of securing his own!</p>

<p>At the supposed sudden death of their daughter the parents
naturally feel some genuine grief; but their conventional wailing
(iv. 5) belongs to the earlier version of the play, and it is significant
that Shakespeare let it stand when revising his work some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
years afterwards. As Tieck remarks, it "had not the true tragic
ring"&mdash;and why should it?</p>

<p>Most of the critics have assumed that Shakespeare makes Juliet
only fourteen, because of her Italian birth; but in the original Italian
versions of the story she is eighteen, and Brooke makes her sixteen.
All of Shakespeare's other youthful heroines whose ages are
definitely stated or indicated are very young. Miranda, in <cite>The
Tempest</cite>, is barely fifteen, as she has been "twelve year" on the enchanted
island and was "not out [full] three years old" when her
father was driven from Milan. Marina, in <cite>Pericles</cite>, is only fifteen
at the end of the play; and Perdita only sixteen, as we learn from
the prologue to act iv. of <cite>The Winter's Tale</cite>.</p>

<p>In Juliet's case, I believe that the youthfulness was an essential
element in Shakespeare's conception of the character. With the
parents and the Nurse he has given her, she could only have been,
at the opening of the play, the mere girl he makes her. She must
be too young to have discovered the real character of her father
and mother, and to have been chilled and hardened by learning
how unlike they were to the ideals of her childhood. She must
not have come to comprehend fully the low coarse nature of the
Nurse, her foster-mother. The poet would not have dared to leave
the maiden under the influence of that gross creature till she was
eighteen, or even sixteen. As it is, she has not been harmed by
the prurient vulgarity of the garrulous dame. She never shows
any interest in it, or seems even to notice it. When her mother
first refers to the suit of Paris (i. 3) we see that no thought of love
or marriage has ever occurred to her, and the glowing description
of a noble and wealthy young wooer does not excite her imagination
in the least. Her only response to all that the Lady and the Nurse
have urged in praise of Paris is coldly acquiescent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"I'll look to like, if looking liking move;</div>
  <div class="i0">But no more deep will I endart mine eye</div>
  <div class="i0">Than your consent gives strength to make it fly."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>The playful manner in which Juliet receives the advances of
Romeo (i. 5. 95-109) is thoroughly girlish, though we must note
that his first speech, as given in the play ("If I profane," etc.), is
not the beginning of their conversation, which has been going on
while Capulet and Tybalt were talking. This is the first and the
last glimpse that we get of her bright young sportiveness. With the
kiss that ends the pretty quibbling the girl learns what love means,
and the larger life of womanhood begins.</p>

<p>The "balcony scene" (ii. 2)&mdash;the most exquisite love scene ever
written&mdash;is in perfect keeping with the poet's conception of Juliet
as little more than a child&mdash;still childlike in the expression of the
new love that is making her a woman. Hence the absolute frankness
in her avowal of that love&mdash;an ideal love in which passion
and purity are perfectly interfused. There is not a suggestion of
sensuality on Romeo's part any more than on hers. When he asks,
"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?" it is only the half-involuntary
utterance of the man's impatience&mdash;so natural to the man&mdash;that
the full fruition of his love must be delayed. Juliet knows that
it involves no base suggestion, and a touch of tender sympathy
and pity is mingled with the maiden wisdom of the innocent response,
"What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?"</p>

<p>Lady Martin (Helena Faucit), who has played the part of Juliet
with rare power and grace, and has written about it no less admirably,
remarks on this scene: "Women are deeply in debt to Shakespeare
for all the lovely and noble things he has put into his
women's hearts and mouths, but surely for nothing more than for
the words in which Juliet's reply [to Romeo, when he has overheard
her soliloquy in the balcony] is couched. Only one who
knew of what a true woman is capable, in frankness, in courage,
and self-surrender when her heart is possessed by a noble love,
could have touched with such delicacy, such infinite charm of
mingled reserve and artless frankness, the avowal of so fervent, yet
so modest a love, the secret of which had been so strangely stolen
from her. As the whole scene is the noblest pæan to Love ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
written, so is what Juliet says supreme in subtlety of feeling and expression,
where all is beautiful. Watch all the fluctuations of emotion
which pervade it, ... the generous frankness of the giving,
the timid drawing back, fearful of having given too much unsought;
the perplexity of the whole, all summed up in that sweet
entreaty for pardon with which it closes."</p>

<p>Juliet's soliloquy in iii. 3 is no less remarkable for its chaste and
reverent dealing with a situation even more perilous for the dramatist.
We must not forget that it <i>is</i> a soliloquy, "breathed out
in the silence and solitude of her chamber," as Mrs. Jameson
reminds us; or, we may say, not so much as breathed out, but only
thought and felt, unuttered even when no one could have heard
it. As spoken to a theatrical audience, it is only to a sympathetic
listener who appreciates the situation that it can have its
true effect, and one feels almost guilty and ashamed at having intruded
upon the sacred privacy of the maiden meditation. Even
to comment upon it seems like profanity.</p>

<p>Here, as in the balcony scene, Juliet is simply the "impatient
child" to whom she compares herself, looking forward with mingled
innocence and eagerness to the fruition of the "tender wishes
blossoming at night" that inspire the soliloquy.</p>

<p>In one of Romeo's speeches in the interview with Friar Laurence
after the death of Tybalt (iii. 3), there is a delicate tribute to the
girlish purity and timidity of Juliet, though it occurs in a connection
so repellent to our taste that we may fail to note it. This is
the passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 12em;">"heaven is here,</span></div>
  <div class="i0">Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog</div>
  <div class="i0">And little mouse, every unworthy thing,</div>
  <div class="i0">Live here in heaven and may look on her,</div>
  <div class="i0">But Romeo may not. More validity,</div>
  <div class="i0">More honourable state, more courtship lives</div>
  <div class="i0">In carrion-flies than Romeo. They may seize</div>
  <div class="i0">On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand</div>
  <div class="i0">And steal immortal blessing from her lips,</div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
  <div class="i0">Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,</div>
  <div class="i0">Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin:</div>
  <div class="i0">But Romeo may not, he is banished.</div>
  <div class="i0">This may flies do, when I from this must fly;</div>
  <div class="i0">They are free men, but I am banished."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is unquestionably from the earliest draft of the play, and is
a specimen of the most intolerable class of Elizabethan conceits.
As another has said, "Perhaps the worst line that Shakespeare or
any other poet ever wrote, is the dreadful one where Romeo, in the
very height of his passionate despair, says, 'This may <i>flies</i> do, but
I from this must <i>fly</i>.'" It comes in "with an obtrusive incongruity
which absolutely makes one shudder." The allusion to the "carrion
flies" is bad enough, but the added pun on <i>fly</i>, which makes
the allusion appear deliberate and elaborate rather than an unfortunate
lapse due to the excitement of the moment, forbids any
attempt to excuse or palliate it. But we must not overlook the
exquisite reference to Juliet's lips, that&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i2">"even in pure and vestal modesty</div>
  <div class="i0">Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There we have the true Juliet&mdash;the Juliet whose maiden modesty
and innocence certain critics (in their comments upon the soliloquy
in iii. 3) have been too gross to comprehend. It is to Romeo's
honour that he can understand and feel it even when recalling the
passionate exchange of conjugal kisses.</p>

<p>The scene (iv. 3) in which Juliet drinks the potion has been misinterpreted
by some of the best critics. Coleridge says that she
"swallows the draught in a fit of fright," for it would have been
"too bold a thing" for a girl of fourteen to have done it otherwise.
Mrs. Jameson says that, "gradually and most naturally, in such a
mind once <i>thrown off its poise</i>, the horror rises to <i>frenzy</i>,&mdash;her
imagination realizes its own hideous creations,"&mdash;that is, after picturing
all the possible horrors of the tomb, she <i>sees</i>, or believes she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
sees, the ghost of Tybalt, and drinks the potion in the frenzied
apprehension the vision excites. On the contrary, as George
Fletcher remarks, "the very clearness and completeness with which
her mind embraces her present position make her pass in lucid review,
and in the most natural and logical sequence, the several dismal
contingencies that await her"&mdash;thus leading up, "step by step,
to this climax of the accumulated horrors, not which she <i>may</i>, but
which she <i>must</i> encounter, if she wake before the calculated moment.
This pressure on her brain, crowned by the vivid apprehension
of <i>anticipated</i> frenzy, does, indeed, amid her dim and silent
loneliness, produce a momentary hallucination [of Tybalt's ghost],
but she instantly recovers herself, recognizes the illusion, ... embraces
the one chance of earthly reunion with her lord&mdash;'Romeo,
I come! this do I drink to thee!'"</p>

<p>This is substantially Lady Martin's interpretation of the scene,
and that which she carried out in action on the stage. She says:
"For the moment the great fear gets the better of her great love,
and all seems madness. Then in her frenzy of excitement she
seems to see Tybalt's figure 'seeking out Romeo.' At the mention
of Romeo's name I used to feel all my resolution return. Romeo!
She goes to meet him, and what terror shall hold her back? She
will pass through the horror of hell itself to reach what lies beyond;
and she swallows the potion with his name upon her lips." The
lady adds: "What it is to act it I need not tell. What power it
demands! and yet what restraint!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Romeo.</span>&mdash;Some critics have expressed surprise that Shakespeare
should have preluded the main story of the drama with the "superfluous
complication" of Romeo's love for Rosaline. On the
other hand, Coleridge considers it "a strong instance of the fineness
of his insight into the nature of the passions." He adds:
"The necessity of loving creates an object for itself in man and
woman; and yet there is a difference in this respect between the
sexes, though only to be known by a perception of it. It would
have displeased us if Juliet had been represented as already in love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
or as fancying herself so; but no one, I believe, ever experiences
any shock at Romeo's forgetting his Rosaline, who had been a mere
name for the yearning of his youthful imagination, and rushing into
his passion for Juliet." Mrs. Jameson says: "Our impression of
Juliet's loveliness and sensibility is enhanced when we find it overcoming
in the bosom of Romeo a previous love for another. His
visionary passion for the cold, inaccessible Rosaline forms but the
prologue, the threshold, to the true, the real sentiment which succeeds
to it. This incident, which is found in the original story, has
been retained by Shakspeare with equal feeling and judgment;
and, far from being a fault in taste and sentiment, far from prejudicing
us against Romeo by casting on him, at the outset of the
piece, the stigma of inconstancy, it becomes, if properly considered,
a beauty in the drama, and adds a fresh stroke of truth to the portrait
of the lover. Why, after all, should we be offended at what
does not offend Juliet herself? for in the original story we find that
her attention is first attracted towards Romeo by seeing him 'fancy-sick
and pale of cheer,' for love of a cold beauty."</p>

<p>The German critic Kreyssig aptly remarks: "We make the acquaintance
of Romeo at the critical period of that not dangerous
sickness to which youth is liable. It is that 'love lying in the eyes'
of early and just blossoming manhood, that humorsome, whimsical
'love in idleness,' that first bewildered, stammering interview of the
heart with the scarcely awakened nature. Strangely enough, objections
have been made to this 'superfluous complication,' as if, down
to this day, every Romeo had not to sigh for some Junonian Rosaline,
nay, for half a dozen Rosalines, more or less, before his eyes
open upon his Juliet."</p>

<p>Young men of ardent and sentimental nature, as Kreyssig intimates,
imagine themselves in love&mdash;sometimes again and again&mdash;before
a genuine passion takes possession of them. As Rosalind
expresses it, Cupid may have "clapped them on the shoulder," but,
they are really "heart-whole." Such love is like that of the song in
<cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="container">
<div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza">
  <div class="i0">"It is engender'd in the eyes,</div>
  <div class="i0">By gazing fed, and fancy dies</div>
  <div class="i0">In the cradle where it lies."</div>
 </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It lives only until it is displaced by a healthier, more vigorous love,
capable of outgrowing the precarious period of infancy.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This is
not the only instance of the kind in Shakespeare. Orsino's experience
in <cite>Twelfth Night</cite> is similar to Romeo's. At the beginning
of the play he is suffering from unrequited love for Olivia, but
later finds his Juliet in Viola.</p>

<p>Romeo is a very young man&mdash;if indeed we may call him a man
when we first meet him. We may suppose him to be twenty, but
hardly older. He has seen very little of society, as we infer from
Benvolio's advising him to go to the masquerade at Capulet's, in
order to compare "the admired beauties of Verona" with Rosaline.
He had thought her "fair, none else being by." He is hardly less
"a stranger in the world" than Juliet himself. Love develops him
as it does her, but more slowly.</p>

<p>Contrast the strength of Juliet's new-born heroism in her budding
womanhood, when she drinks the potion that is to consign her to
the horrors of the charnel-house, with the weakness of Romeo who
is ready to kill himself when he learns that he is to be banished
from Verona,&mdash;an insignificant fate compared with that which
threatens her&mdash;banishment from home, a beggar in the streets,&mdash;the
only alternative a criminal marriage that would forever separate
her from her lawful husband, or death to escape that guilt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
wretchedness. No wonder that the Friar cannot control his contempt
and indignation when Romeo draws his sword:&mdash;</p>

<p>He has the form of a man, but talks and acts like a weak girl,
while the girl of fourteen whom he loves&mdash;a child three days
before, we might say&mdash;now shows a self-control and fortitude
worthy of a man.</p>

<p>Romeo does not attain to true manhood until he receives the
tidings of Juliet's supposed death. "Now, for the first time," as
Dowden says, "he is completely delivered from the life of dream,
completely adult, and able to act with an initiative in his own will,
and with manly determination. Accordingly, he now speaks with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
masculine directness and energy: 'Is it even so? Then I defy
you, stars!' Yes; he is now master of events; the stars cannot
alter his course. 'Nothing,' as Maginn has observed, 'can be more
quiet than his final determination, "Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee
to night." ... It is plain Juliet. His mind is made up; the
whole course of the short remainder of his life so unalterably fixed
that it is perfectly useless to think more about it.' These words,
because they are the simplest, are amongst the most memorable
that Romeo utters. Now passion, imagination, and will are fused
together, and Romeo who was weak has at length become strong."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mercutio.</span>&mdash;Dryden quotes a traditional saying concerning Mercutio,
that if Shakespeare had not killed him, he would have killed
Shakespeare. But Shakespeare was never driven to disposing of a
personage in that way, because he was unequal to the effort of
maintaining the full vigour or brilliancy of the characterization.
He did not have to kill off Falstaff, for instance, until he had carried
him through three complete plays, and then only because his
"occupation," dramatically speaking, "was gone." There was the
same reason for killing Mercutio. The dramatist had no further
use for him after the quarrel with Tybalt which leads to his death.
In both the novel and the poem, Romeo kills Tybalt in a street
brawl between the partisans of the rival houses. The dramatic
effect of the scene in the play where Romeo avoids being drawn
into a conflict with Tybalt until driven to incontrollable grief and
wrath by the death of his friend is far more impressive. The self-control
and self-restraint of Romeo, in spite of the insults of Tybalt
and the disgust of Mercutio at what seems to him "calm, dishonourable,
vile submission," show how reluctant the lover of Juliet is to
fight with her kinsman. He does his best to restrain his friend
from the duel: "Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up&mdash;" but to no
purpose; nor is his appeal to Benvolio to "beat down their
weapons" more successful. He then attempts to do this himself,
but the only result is to bring about the death of Mercutio, who
exclaims: "Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
your arm." Poor Romeo can only plead, "I thought all for the
best."</p>

<p>But at this point in the play, when the tragic complication really
begins, the dramatist must dismiss Mercutio from the stage, as he
does with Falstaff after Prince Hal has become King. Mercutio
must not come in contact with Juliet, nor will Romeo himself care
to meet him. He is the most foul-mouthed of Shakespeare's
characters, the clowns and profligates not excepted. The only
instance in Shakespeare's works in which the original editions omit
a word from the text is in a speech of Mercutio's; and Pope, who
could on occasion be as coarse as any author of that licentious age,
felt obliged to drop two of Mercutio's lines from his edition of the
dramatist. Fortunately, the majority of the knight's gross allusions
are so obscure that they would not be understood nowadays,
even by readers quite familiar with the language of the time.</p>

<p>And yet Mercutio is a fellow of excellent fancy&mdash;poetical fancy&mdash;as
the familiar description of Queen Mab amply proves. Critics
have picked it to pieces and found fault with some of the details;
but there was never a finer mingling of exquisite poetry with keen
and sparkling wit. Its imperfections and inconsistencies, if such
they be, are in keeping with the character and the situation. It
was meant to be a brilliant improvisation, not a carefully elaborated
composition. Shakespeare may, indeed, have written the speech as
rapidly and carelessly as he makes Mercutio speak it.</p>

<h3><a name="TIME_ANALYSIS" id="TIME_ANALYSIS"></a><span class="smcap">The Time-analysis of the Play</span></h3>


<p>This is summed up by Mr. P.A. Daniel in his valuable paper
"On the Times or Durations of the Actions of Shakspere's Plays"
(<cite>Trans. of New Shaks. Soc.</cite> 1877-79, p. 194) as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Time of this Tragedy, six consecutive days, commencing on the
morning of the first, and ending early in the morning of the sixth.</p>

<blockquote><p>Day 1. (Sunday) Act I. and Act II. sc. i. and ii.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. (Monday) Act II. sc. iii.-vi., Act III. sc. i.-iv.</p>

<p>Day 3. (Tuesday) Act III. sc. v., Act IV. sc. i.-iv.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p> &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; 4. (Wednesday) Act IV. sc. v.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; 5. (Thursday) Act V.</p>

<p> &nbsp; "&nbsp; &nbsp; 6. (Friday) End of Act V. sc. iii."</p></blockquote>

<p>After the above was printed, Dr. Furnivall called Mr. Daniel's
attention to my note on page 249 fol. in which I show that the
drama may close on Thursday morning instead of Friday. Mr.
Daniel was at first disinclined to accept this view, but on second
thought was compelled to admit that I was right.</p>

<p class="p2">Edited by WILLIAM J. ROLFE, Litt.D.</p>

<p class="p2">40 volumes, each, $0.56</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE popularity of Rolfe's Shakespeare has been extraordinary.
Since its first publication in 1870-83
it has been used more widely, both in schools and
colleges, and by the general reading public, than any similar
edition ever issued. It is to-day the standard annotated
edition of Shakespeare for educational purposes.</p>

<p>¶ As teacher and lecturer Dr. Rolfe has been constantly in
touch with the recent notable advances made in Shakespearian
investigation and criticism; and this revised edition he
has carefully adjusted to present conditions.</p>

<p>¶ The introductions and appendices have been entirely rewritten,
and now contain the history of the plays and poems;
an account of the sources of the plots, with copious extracts
from the chronicles and novels from which the poet drew
his material; and general comments by the editor, with
selections from the best English and foreign criticism.</p>

<p>¶ The notes are very full, and include all the historical,
critical, and illustrative material needed by the teacher, as
well as by the student, and general reader. Special features
in the notes are the extent to which Shakespeare is
made to explain himself by parallel passages from his works;
the frequent Bible illustrations; the full explanations of allusions
to the manners and customs of the period; and descriptions
of the localities connected with the poet's life and works.</p>

<p>¶ New notes have also been substituted for those referring
to other volumes of the edition, so that each volume is now
absolutely complete in itself. The form of the books has
been modified, the page being made smaller to adjust them
to pocket use.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p6">A HISTORY OF ENGLISH<br />
LITERATURE</p>

<p class="p2">By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A. (Yale),<br />
Louisville Male High School. Price, $1.25</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="drop-cap">H</span>ALLECK'S HISTORY OF ENGLISH LITERATURE
traces the development of that literature
from the earliest times to the present in a
concise, interesting, and stimulating manner. Although the
subject is presented so clearly that it can be readily comprehended
by high school pupils, the treatment is sufficiently
philosophic and suggestive for any student beginning the
study.</p>

<p>¶ The book is a history of literature, and not a mere collection
of biographical sketches. Only enough of the facts
of an author's life are given to make students interested in
him as a personality, and to show how his environment
affected his work. Each author's productions, their relations
to the age, and the reasons why they hold a position
in literature, receive adequate treatment.</p>

<p>¶ One of the most striking features of the work consists in
the way in which literary movements are clearly outlined at
the beginning of each chapter. Special attention is given to
the essential qualities which differentiate one period from
another, and to the animating spirit of each age. The author
shows that each period has contributed something definite
to the literature of England.</p>

<p>¶ At the end of each chapter a carefully prepared list of
books is given to direct the student in studying the original
works of the authors treated. He is told not only what to
read, but also where to find it at the least cost. The book
contains a special literary map of England in colors.</p></blockquote>

<p class="p6">THE MASTERY OF BOOKS</p>

<p class="p2">By HARRY LYMAN KOOPMAN, A.M., Librarian
of Brown University. Price, 90 cents</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="drop-cap">I</span>N this book Mr. Koopman, whose experience and
reputation as a librarian give him unusual qualifications
as an adviser, presents to the student at the outset the
advantages of reading, and the great field of literature
open to the reader's choice. He takes counsel with the
student as to his purpose, capacities, and opportunities in
reading, and aims to assist him in following such methods
and in turning to such classes of books as will further the
attainment of his object.</p>

<p>¶ Pains are taken to provide the young student from the
beginning with a knowledge, often lacking in older readers,
of the simplest literary tools&mdash;reference books and catalogues.
An entire chapter is given to the discussion of
the nature and value of that form of printed matter which
forms the chief reading of the modern world&mdash;periodical
literature. Methods of note-taking and of mnemonics
are fully described; and a highly suggestive and valuable
chapter is devoted to language study.</p>

<p>¶ One of the most valuable chapters in the volume to
most readers is that concerning courses of reading. In
accordance with the author's new plan for the guidance
of readers, a classified list of about fifteen hundred books
is given, comprising the most valuable works in reference
books, periodicals, philosophy, religion, mythology and
folk-lore, biography, history, travels, sociology, natural
sciences, art, poetry, fiction, Greek, Latin, and modern
literatures. The latest and best editions are specified, and
the relative value of the several works mentioned is indicated
in notes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>HE fundamental aim of this volume is to enable pupils
to express their thoughts freely, clearly, and forcibly.
At the same time it is designed to cultivate literary
appreciation, and to develop some knowledge of rhetorical
theory. The work follows closely the requirements of the
College Entrance Examination Board, and of the New
York State Education Department.</p>

<p>¶ In Part One are given the elements of description, narration,
exposition, and argument; also special chapters on letter-writing
and poetry. A more complete and comprehensive
treatment of the four forms of discourse already discussed is
furnished in Part Two. In each part is presented a series of
themes covering these subjects, the purpose being to give the
pupil inspiration, and that confidence in himself which comes
from the frequent repetition of an act. A single new principle
is introduced into each theme, and this is developed in
the text, and illustrated by carefully selected examples.</p>

<p>¶ The pupils are taught how to correct their own errors,
and also how to get the main thought in preparing their
lessons. Careful coördination with the study of literature
and with other school studies is made throughout the book.</p>

<p>¶ The modern character of the illustrative extracts can not
fail to interest every boy and girl. Concise summaries are
given following the treatment of the various forms of discourse,
and toward the end of the book there is a very comprehensive
and compact summary of grammatical principles. More than
usual attention is devoted to the treatment of argument.</p></blockquote>

It is based on the historic method of study, and refers
briefly to events in each period bearing on social development,
to changes in religious and political theory,
and even to advances in the industrial arts. In addition,
the book contains critiques, general surveys, summaries,
biographical sketches, bibliographies, and suggestive

know about the construction of English verse, and its main
divisions, both by forms and by subject-matter. The historical
development of the main divisions is sketched, and briefly illustrated by
representative examples; but the true character of poetry as an art and
as a social force has always been in the writer's mind. Only the
elements of prosody are given. The aim has been not to make the
study too technical, but to interest the student in poetry, and to aid him
in acquiring a well-rooted taste for good literature.</p></blockquote>

chairman read a paper by Mr. Ruskin on the word <i>fret</i> in this passage.
The following is from the report in the London <cite>Academy</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Fret</i> means primarily the rippling of the cloud&mdash;as sea by wind; secondarily,
the breaking it asunder for light to come through. It implies a
certain degree of vexation, some dissolution, much order, and extreme
beauty. The reader should have seen 'Daybreak,' and think what is
broken and by what. The cloud of night is broken up, by Day, which
breaks out, breaks in, as from heaven to earth, with a breach in the cloud
wall of it. The thing that the day breaks up is partly a garment <i>rent</i>,
the blanket of the dark torn to be peeped through...."</p></div>

<p>That is about the average span of its "eternity." In Romeo's case it
did not last even two months, as we may infer from the fact (i. 1. 136)
that his parents have not found out the cause of it, and from what his
friends say about it.</p>
